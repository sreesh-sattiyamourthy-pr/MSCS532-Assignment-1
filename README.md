# MSCS532-Assignment-1

This program implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers
in monotonically decreasing order. The Insertion Sort algorithm works by
iteratively inserting each element from an unsorted portion of the list into 
its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the concept of sorting algorithms 
and to practice using version control through GitHub.
